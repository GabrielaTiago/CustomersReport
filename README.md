# Customers Report

This project aims to build two pages in ReportLab programmatically. The pages will be built inside a class object, where each class instance represents a Customer's Report with its own handling of states, data, etc.

## Task Description

The task involves the following requirements:

1. Build the two pages using ReportLab.
2. The pages should be built inside a class object.
3. Each class instance represents a Customer's Report.
4. All text can be hardcoded directly within the class as these are static pages.
5. For Task 1, the two paragraphs must be split such that no matter how long the paragraph is, they are split mostly evenly across the two columns.
